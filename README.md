# 🩻 CT Scan Noise Removal using Median Filtering

## 📖 Overview
This project removes **noise (especially salt-and-pepper noise)** from a CT scan image using the **Median Filtering** technique in Python.  
Median filtering is a simple yet powerful image processing method that smoothens images while preserving important edges and details.

## 🎯 Aim
To remove noise from a CT scan image using **median filtering** and improve image clarity for better medical interpretation.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
CT scans often contain random noise caused by scanning conditions or transmission errors.  
This noise affects the accuracy of diagnosis.  
A simple and efficient way to remove such noise is to use **median filtering**, which replaces each pixel with the median of its neighboring pixels.
